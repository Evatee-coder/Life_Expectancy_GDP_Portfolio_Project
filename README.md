Topic: On The Relation Between GDP and Life Expectancy: Unraveling the Global Trends and Disparities

1. Introduction To Data Research
This study examine the relationship between countries Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its life expectancy, exploring the factors, patterns, and disparities that shape the health and prosperity of nations. Through comprehensive analysis and data-driven insights, this research aims to identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries. Secondly, the study uncovers the complex interplay between economic development and the well-being of selected countries populations.

2. Background
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key economic indicator that measures the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders within a specific time period, typically annually or quarterly. It is used to assess the economic performance and the size of an economy. On the other hand, Life expectancy is a statistical measure that estimates the average number of years a person or a group of people can expect to live, based on current mortality rates and other demographic factors. It is typically expressed as the number of years one can expect to live at birth, assuming that current mortality rates remain constant throughout one's lifetime. In other words, life expectancy provides an estimate of the average lifespan for a given population.

3. Main goal of the study
To prepare and analyze data on GDP and life expectancy obtained from the World Health Organization and the World Bank. In addition, we plot data in order to answer the questions below;

    Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
    Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
    Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
    What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
    What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

4. An accompanying paragraph describing the following visualizations
   
Violin plot
In the Violin plot of GDP, the United State of America and China exhibit a broader range, whereas Zimbabwe, Chile, and Mexico have more constrained ranges. On the other hand for life expectancy, most countries have narrowe ranges, except for Zimbabwe, that displays a broader range that spans from the upper 30s to the upper 60s. The Violin plot offers an additional way to visualize the distributions of individual elements and identify patterns in their shapes. This type of plot is widely favored due to its ability to showcase the distribution's shape in comparison to a traditional box plot.

facet grid of scatter graphs
To better understand the connection between GDP and Life expectancy in different countries, we created individual scatter plots for each nation using separate sections, as depicted in the figure above. It's evident that many countries display robust linear relationships with significant positive correlations between GDP and life expectancy. However, China's plot takes on an exponential curve. By examining each country's unique plot of GDP against life expectancy, we observe that Zimbabwe notably maintains a strong positive correlation for life expectancies exceeding 50 years. For life expectancies less than 50 years, the relationship becomes less distinct.


facet grid of line graphs
Likewise, we directed our attention towards the examination of GDP trends using faceted line plots, organized by country. As depicted in the separate plots presented above, each country has their own y axis, which makes it easier to compare the shape of their GDP over the years using their corresponsing scale. This approach enhances the clarity in discerning the distinctive shapes of GDP evolution across the represented countries. Through this method, the overarching trend becomes evident: all countries have undergone positive growth in their GDP. In the chart above, the other country's GDP growth looked modest compared to China and the US, but all of the countries did experience growth from the year 2000.



5. Conclusions

Overall, the project managed to generate several informative data visualizations using a relatively small dataset consisting of only 96 rows and 4 columns.

Furthermore, the project successfully addressed the questions posed initially:

    Has life expectancy increased increased over time in the six nations?
        Yes, with Zimbabwe showing the most significant increase.

    Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
        Indeed, GDPs have shown upward trends across all countries on the list, with China experiencing notably substantial growth.

    Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
        Yes, a strong positive correlation exists between GDP and life expectancy among the countries in our study.

    What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
        The average life expectancy ranged from the mid to high 70s for most countries, except for Zimbabwe, where it stood at 50.

    What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
        The distribution of life expectancy exhibited a left skew, indicating that the majority of observations clustered towards the higher values on the right side of the distribution.
